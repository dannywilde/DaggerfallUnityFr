Record n�0----------
You are loyal member of the Mages Guild,
 are you not, %pct?  I have some guild
 business of the gravest import that
 I would like you to handle.


Record n�1----------
Perhaps you are not as loyal as I thought.


Record n�2----------
Very good.  There is a rebel mage that we
 need eliminated, by the name of _rebel_.
 A former pupil of mine, showed some promise
 but lacked the loyalty to the ancient principles
 of the Guild that are so important to its
 continued survival.  We have learned that
 %g is currently doing some kind of unsanctioned
 research over in __rebelhouse_, apparently
 oblivious to %g3 danger.  You have =qtime_ days
 to dispose of this menace and report back to me.


Record n�3----------
Begone, %pcn.


Record n�4----------
I made this _reward_ myself as a
 token of my appreciation for your service
 to the Mages Guild.


Record n�5----------
%qdt:
 I have undertaken to find and
 destroy a rebel mage, who currently
 resides in __rebelhouse_.  Once I
 have disposed of this mage, _rebel_,
 I am to report back to _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_'s Mages Guild.
 I have =qtime_ days.


Record n�6----------
%qdt:
 I agreed to spare _rebel_'s life.
 %g said I should just tell _questgiver_
 that I found no sign of _rebel_ in 
 __rebelhouse_, except for a letter which
 %g gave me.


Record n�7----------
So, _questgiver_ has sent another
 of %g3 lackeys to bring me to heel.
 The old women who run the Mages Guild
 have no sense of adventure, take no risks,
 dare nothing, and learn nothing.  I have
 never lifted a finger against them, except
 to repudiate their control.  Yet, simply
 because I refuse to abide by their rules,
 the Mages Guild would slay me!  Why do you
 give them your blind obedience, killing on
 command like a hired assassin?  Join me
 and we will defy them all!


Record n�8----------
Wonderful!  Just tell old _questgiver_
 that I was not here, but left this letter
 for %g2.  I must depart, but I will
 contact you as soon as I can cook us
 up a truly smashing adventure.  Ta ta!


Record n�9----------
Well then, I shall have to convince you
 the hard way.  Defend yourself, mageling!


Record n�10----------
Dear _questgiver_,
 
   So sorry I missed you.  I would love
 to catch up on old times with you. Do you
 remember the days when I dutifully learned
 at your knee, as if you had more to teach me
 than the stale repetition of past greatness?
 =mage1_, the Archmagister =mage3_ --
 in their day the Mages Guild was an institution
 worthy of respect.  No more. I cannot offer my
 allegiance to a Guild whose sole purpose is to
 quash all original thought.
 
   If you send more of your enforcers against
 me, I will be forced to defend myself.  Consider
 yourself warned.
 
 Your humble pupil,
 
 _rebel_


Record n�11----------
Why...that impertinent!  I am
 speechless!  You can now see
 why _rebel_ must be stopped
 at all costs, before %g undermines
 everything the Guild stands for.
 It is unfortunate that you missed
 that miserable little sot, but I have
 no doubt that we will soon
 track %g2 down again.


Record n�12----------
Very good, %pct.  The Mages Guild
 cannot survive if we do not enforce
 our own rules, harsh as they may seem.


Record n�13----------
Stop this pointless attack, and
 join me instead!


Record n�14----------
Surely you are ready to concede
 my point.  We could have such fun together!


Record n�15----------
_questgiver_ has taught you persistence,
 at least.  But why remain a slave to the
 rules and regulations of the hidebound?
 Join my merry band of Guild defiers!


Record n�16----------
You are beginning to try my patience,
 but I will give you one last chance.
 Cease your attack, and I will let
 bygones be bygones.


Record n�17----------
Perhaps we should take this outside.


Record n�18----------
Yoo-hoo, over here!


Record n�19----------
Did _questgiver_ forget to tell you about
 my skill in magicka when %g was preaching
 about my disloyalty and insubordination?


Record n�20----------
Missed me again, my good Guild Drone.  Why haven't
 your Guild masters taught you these tricks?
