%pcn, isn't it?
Just who I was looking for.
We have a rather interesting job,
requiring a bit of brains rather
than brawn. Are you interested?


Record n�1----------
Yeah, you're right, I did say this
job needed brains didn't I?


Record n�2----------
Here's the situation. Seems _dummy_
has this pet sabertooth tiger -- don't
ask -- and it ran off a few days ago.
%g had it tracked to ___mondung_,
but now we need someone to go in there
and bring it out. Alive. The trick
is that it's been trained to respond
to this bell. The tiger should become
docile if you ring the bell in its face.
Of course, _dummy_ did say it isn't
trained too well -- are you surprised? --
so you may have to smack it upside the
head once or twice to get its attention.
Just don't kill it, OK?  Bring it back
to _dummy_ at __dummy_ in one piece
within =qtime_ days, and %g'll pay
you _gold_ gold. Good luck.


Record n�3----------
Don't look at me. The tiger is
in ___mondung_. Take your
little bell and get going.


Record n�4----------
Oh, =tiger_, darling, you're safe!
Thank you so much for bringing my
baby back home to me. I'm sure
he didn't give you any trouble,
did he? He's just a big kitty cat
at heart, wouldn't hurt a fly.
Here's your _gold_ gold, just like
I promised that nice _questgiver_
at the Fighter's Guild.


Record n�5----------
Did you hear that _dummy_'s tiger escaped again?  Killed and
ate three people this time.


Record n�6----------
_dummy_'s tiger seems to have disappeared for good. Thank %god!



Record n�7----------
_dummy_ actually hired someone from the Fighter's Guild to 
go
fetch %g3 pet tiger for %g2. What sap would take a silly job like 
that?


Record n�8----------
Howdy, %pcf, you old tiger-lover, you!


Record n�9----------
I can't really think of an easier job than finding a pet tiger, 
but
you managed to screw it up. What do you want now?


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 I have been hired by ___questgiver_'s
 Fighters Guild to find a pet sabertooth
 tiger that has run off into ___mondung_.
 Supposedly the tiger is trained to respond
 to a bell I was given, but _questgiver_
 warned me that it may not really be trained
 very well. I am to bring the tiger back
 to its owner, _dummy_, at __dummy_
 of ___dummy_ within =qtime_ days.
 %g'll pay me _gold_ gold.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I found the tiger in ___mondung_,
 and now it seems to like me. It has
 started following me, at least. Now
 I just have to get it back to _dummy_
 in ___dummy_.


Record n�12----------
Oops. You killed the tiger.
I wonder what _dummy_ will say?


Record n�13----------
You ring the bell loudly,
but it doesn't seem to have
any effect.


Record n�14----------
The tiger's ears perk up at
the sound of the bell. It
shakes its great head from side
to side, and begins emitting
a low growling sound. Is it
purring? The tiger pads over
and rubs against your legs,
nearly knocking you over.
 
The tiger is now following you.


Record n�15----------
You horrible horrible %ra!
I can't believe you killed my
poor innocent =tiger_. Just
a sweet lost kitty, and you
just had to slaughter it.
Get out of here at once,
before I have you arrested
for murder. Get out!


Record n�16----------
Dear _love_,
 
 I am sorry I can't be with you today
 in __lovehouse_, but I wanted to take a
 moment to let you know that you are
 in my thoughts as always, my sweet.
 I am sitting here under a tree, on a
 beautiful afternoon that reminds me
 of you. Everything reminds me of you,
 my darling, the shining sun in the sky,
 the chirping birds in the trees, even
 the pretty pet tiger walking with its
 owner over there. Ha ha! The tiger has
 gotten loose, the scamp. It is bounding
 over my way. See how its coat gleams in
 the sun, like your hair in the firelight.
 Its owner is shouting something and ringing
 a little bell, but it doesn't listen. Such
 a high spirited beast! It seems friendly
 enough, here it comes to say hello...


Record n�17----------
Yes, what do you want?  Oh...good
gracious, a letter from _victim_!
Why is it stained with blood?
%g's dead?  Dear me. %g always
was so sweet to me, I'm afraid
%g had the delusion that we were
in love. Poor soul, what a tragic
end. I certainly appreciate you
telling me what happened. I'll
make sure %g3 family knows. Here,
why don't you take this _magic_
%g gave me. I certainly don't
have any use for it.
