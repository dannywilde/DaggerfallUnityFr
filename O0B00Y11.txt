Record n�0----------
%pcf, a simple game.  An item
 in a house that needs lifting.
 Are you up for it?


Record n�1----------
You'll go far in the Thieves Guild
 with that attitude.  Sure you will.


Record n�2----------
That's the spirit.  As I said,
 nothing complicated about this
 job.  A client wants to get a
 hold of a certain antique ivory
 piece which currently resides
 in _target_ here in __target_.
 You have two days to bring it
 to me, for a finder's fee of
 _reward_ gold.


Record n�3----------
The _heist_?  Where is it?


Record n�4----------
Excellent work, %pcf.  Just the way
 I like these jobs to go, no fuss, no
 muss.  Here's the _reward_ gold, and
 congratulations on a job well done.


Record n�5----------
_dummy_ has hired on a lot of extra guards at _target_ for some 
reason.

Record n�6----------
Did you hear about the bungled break-in at _target_?

Record n�7----------
Someone broke in to _target_ and got away with _dummy_'s precious 
antique
 ivory, right under the noses of all those guards!


Record n�8----------
What can I do for you, my catburgling friend?

Record n�9----------
I can't seem to forget the botch you made of that simple 
heist.

Record n�10----------
_target_ is swarming with hired guards these days.  I don't know 
why.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I have two days to steal a piece
 of antique ivory from _target_
 here in __target_.  I am to
 deliver it to _questgiver_ at
 __questgiver_ for _reward_ gold.



Record n�12----------
%qdt:
 My burglary did not go smoothly.
 _questgiver_ told me to get out
 of town with the ivory.  I am to
 deliver it to _contact_ who
 will meet me in _safehouse_
 in __safehouse_.


Record n�13----------
This looks like the piece of ivory
 _questgiver_ sent you to steal.


Record n�14----------
%pcf, what are you doing here?
 I don't know how you could botch
 such a simple job, but if you
 don't get yourself and that blasted
 ivory out of town, we're all going
 to end up in the slammer, or worse.
 I don't give a damn about your skin,
 but the Thieves Guild has a reputation
 to uphold, and we promised our client
 that item.  Get over to __safehouse_.
 _contact_ will meet you in _safehouse_
 there.  Don't screw up again.


Record n�15----------
Well, if it isn't %pcn, the Inept
 Catburglar?  At least you managed
 to get through with the item.  Says
 something about your brawn, if not
 your brains.  You didn't actually
 expect to still get paid, did you?


Record n�16----------
You're smarter than you look.  Now
 run along before we decide to turn
 you over to the __target_ guard.


Record n�17----------
Then we're just going to have to take
 it off your dead body.


Record n�18----------
%oth, you're a feisty one, aintcha?
 Better get outta here before I have
 to really hurt ya.


Record n�19----------
This %ra scum killed =guard_!


Record n�20----------
Don't move, or I'll cut you down
 where you stand!  Give us the ivory
 you stole from _target_
 and I'll let you go.


Record n�21----------
We know how to deal with murdering
 scum like you.  =posse_, just
 be careful not to get any blood
 on _dummy_'s ivory when you cut
 this %ra's throat.
