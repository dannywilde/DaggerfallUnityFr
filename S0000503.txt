Record n�0----------
%qdt:
 I have received a mysterious summons
 to _tavern_ in __tavern_
 in ____tavern_, I believe by my friend _rebel_.


Record n�1----------
%qdt:
 I have agreed to help _rebel_
 "liberate" a map to ___itemdung_
 from the Mages Guild of __magesguild_.


Record n�2----------
%qdt:
 We have retrieved the map.  _rebel_
 has another matter to attend to, so
 I will meet him back in _tavern_
 in =keytime_ days.


Record n�3----------
%qdt:
 We have retrieved the map.  I have
 offered to go to ___keydung_
 to find a special _key_ which we
 need to enter ___itemdung_.
 I will meet _rebel_ back in
 _tavern_ in =keytime_ days.


Record n�4----------
A tattered map to ___itemdung_.


Record n�5----------
It was good of you to come.  I have a new
project that I think you might be interested
in.  It will involve a little raid on our
friends at the Mages Guild, however.
What do you say?


Record n�6----------
Have it your way.  I thought you and I
were friends, that's all.


Record n�7----------
I knew you couldn't resist!  Here's the plan.
For some time now, I have been searching for
the location of ___itemdung_, reputedly
the resting place of a hoard of magical objects,
including one _item_ that I need for my own
purposes -- another story for another time.
The issue at hand is that I have learned that
the Mages Guild of __magesguild_ has come
into possession of a map to ___itemdung_.
I still have a few friends in the Guild, despite
the official ban against me... The Guild has
no idea what they have, so it is up to us to
liberate the map so that it can be used to
its full potential.


Record n�8----------
Yes, this is the map!


Record n�9----------
_rebel_ raises %g3 staff.
"Ladies, gentlemen, we really must be going now."
A sphere of light bursts from the staff,
blinding you for an instant.


Record n�10----------
I think it would be best to separate for the time
being, to let this hornet's nest calm down a bit.
I have one more matter to attend to before we can
enter ___itemdung_ ... unless you
would like to handle it for me?


Record n�11----------
Very well.  ___itemdung_ cannot be entered without
the key, a _key_ which I have learned is somewhere
in ___keydung_.  Once you get the _key_, meet me
in _tavern_ in __tavern_, say, in =keytime_ days.


Record n�12----------
No matter.  I will need, say, =keytime_ days to
take care of this business.  I will meet you
back in __tavern_, at _tavern_,
when I have acquired the key to
___itemdung_.  Good luck!


Record n�13----------
This must be the _key_, the key to ___itemdung_.


Record n�14----------
With this _key_ in our possession, we are ready to
brave ___itemdung_.  Lead on, my friend!


Record n�15----------
A hollow voice booms,
"Intruders are not welcome here!"


Record n�16----------
You are too late, _rebel_!  It was a simple
matter to follow you to ___itemdung_, once
you had found the _key_ for me.  The _item_
is now mine, and mine alone!


Record n�17----------
"Well, friend %pcf, an enjoyable little jaunt
eh?  I'll take the _item_ and be on my way."
 
Do you give the _item_ to _rebel_?


Record n�18----------
Until next time!


Record n�19----------
So, your true colors at last.
I only asked for one small thing,
yet your greed apparently
knows no bounds.


Record n�20----------
A shadow flits overhead.  A raven
circles, cawing out harshly before
disappearing into the west:
 
"No time!  No time!
_tavern_,
__tavern_
____tavern_!"


Record n�21----------
%pcf, are you lost?
I'm afraid I'll have
to leave you now.
