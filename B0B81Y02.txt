I am _qgiver_ of this
knightly order. I have a most
dangerous quest %pcf. You
are one of the few that could
possibly take it on. A lich is
raising an army of undead. We
need someone to go in and put
a stop to it.


Record n�1----------
I understand, %pcn.
This is too dangerous even for
you. There are one or two other
heroes that might be able to
pull this one off. I'll go ask
them.


Record n�2----------
You are brave indeed. The lich
has made ___dungeon_ into
its lair. Go there and destroy
the foul thing. In =2dung_ days
we will send out someone else,
should you not return.


Record n�3----------
Hail to the hero, %pcn!
Well done! You name shall
be recorded in the histories.


Record n�4----------
%reg is bracing itself for the Lich's onslaught.
All %reg is praying that ==qgiver_ can kill that Lich.


Record n�5----------
The Lich has temporarily left ___dungeon_. Temporarily.
The Lich will return to ___dungeon_. That's a certainty.


Record n�6----------
%reg is saved, and we have ==qgiver_ to thank.
A %ra knight from ==qgiver_ defeated that Arch-Lich.


Record n�7----------
It'd be rude of me not to help the rescuer of %reg, eh?


Record n�8----------
You're lucky that Lich didn't destroy all %reg, %pcf.
%reg was in serious danger from that Lich. And you didn't 
care.


Record n�9----------
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of
 ==qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 charged me with the duty of
 destroying the lich of
 ___dungeon_. I have =2dung_
 days to finish the task.


Record n�10----------
The lich is dead. Without
his magical support, the
army of undead will return
to the grave.


Record n�11----------
...have found a clue at last!
 I dare not even name the lost
 artifact of ancient power that
 it points toward. It is too
 late for me. I will die down
 here in ___dungeon2_,
 lost among it's dark passageways.
 First, I will hide my clue.
 If I cannot...


Record n�12----------
Sorry, %pcn. You didn't
come back for so long that we
thought you were dead. Another
guild member took up the quest.


Record n�13----------
You trudged all the way down here
to speak to me and now you don't
want to continue? Inconceivable!
Get out of my sight!


Record n�14----------
A pox upon you for disturbing
me %pcn. %oth, of course
I know your name, and no I'm not going
to tell you mine. What's the use
in bein' a wizard if you can't
know things normal folks don't.
I also know why your here. You
want Chrysamere, except you
didn't know it by name, did you?
The only way you're gonna get
it is if you do me a favor first.


Record n�15----------
A pox upon you for disturbing
me %pcn. %oth, of course
I know your name. What's the use in
bein' a wizard if you can't know

want The Necromancer's Amulet,
except you didn't know it by
name, did you? The only way
you're gonna get it is if you
do me a favor first.

Record n�18----------
You see, I don't actually know
where your artifact is. My great
grandfather once sought for it.
According to family history, when
he found it the Mages Guild took
it from him and hid it somewhere.
His spirit has never rested easy
since. If you have this lock of
my hair with you when his spirit
is put to rest, he may tell you
where to find what you seek.
He haunts ___dungeon3_.


Record n�19----------
You hold a token of my lineage,
a bit of hair from one of my
decendants. Know ye that I have
wandered these halls for long
decades waiting for this sign.
Go to the _mageguild_ in
__mageguild_. There you
will find what I once lost.


Record n�20----------
%qdt:
 I have found _wizard_ in
 ___dungeon2_. I now must
 seek %g3 great grandfather in
 ___dungeon3_,
 who may be able to tell me the location
 of the artifact. _wizard_ has also given
 me a lock of %g3 hair so that I may lay him
 to rest.


Record n�21----------
%qdt:
 _wizard_'s great grandfather has told me
 that I can find the artifact at _mageguild_
 in __mageguild_.
