Record n�0----------
%pct, I need someone who can cast
 the Open spell.  Please tell me
 you have learned this by now.


Record n�1----------
Really, you need to devote yourself
 to your studies if you expect to
 advance in the Guild.


Record n�2----------
Well, that's a start.  The job I need
 you for is quite simple.  Even a child
 could probably do it, but here you are.
 A local merchant, _merchant_, bought
 an antique chest, but has been unable to
 get it open.  The best locksmiths in
 __shop_ have tried and failed,
 so %g has asked us if we can help.  Now,
 we really don't have time for such trifling
 matters, but the Guild could use %g3
 patronage, so I agreed to send someone.
 From what I am told, it sounds like one
 of _mage_'s trick boxes.  %g made
 hundreds of them in %g3 day, mainly as
 gifts for %g3 friends, and they still
 turn up from time to time, as the workman-
 ship really is outstanding... where was I?
 Oh yes, well, the secret to these boxes
 is that they are almost impossible to open
 in any way except by the use of the simple,
 standard Open spell.  %g specifically made
 them resistant to the fancy alternative spells
 %g3 friends liked to use.  Yes, %g tended to
 waste %g3 considerable talents on jokes like
 this.  A real shame.  Well, run along.


Record n�3----------
%pct, leave me in peace and run along.
 I have work to do and so do you,
 if I'm not mistaken.


Record n�4----------
Eh?  What do you want?  Oh yes, the
 trick box.  I trust it didn't give
 you any difficulty.  A little good
 publicity for the Mages Guild
 and all that rot.  Jolly good.


Record n�5----------
Did you hear about _merchant_?  %g bought an old chest
 and now %g can't open it.  What a hoot!


Record n�6----------
_merchant_ finally gave up on his magic box and sold it to someone 
else.


Record n�7----------
_merchant_ got the Mages Guild to open %g3 trick box, and it 
turned
 out to be empty!  At least that's what I heard.


Record n�8----------
Hullo, %pcn.  I remember you.  _mage_'s magic box, yes?


Record n�9----------
For heaven's sake, what do you want now?  You're the
 fool that couldn't even open that trick box of 
_merchant_'s.


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of ___questgiver_'s
 Mages Guild has asked me to open
 an old chest for _merchant_,
 a local merchant.  _questgiver_
 believes it is probably a trick
 box that only a standard Open
 spell will open.  I suppose
 I should return to see %g2 when
 I am done.


Record n�11----------
The Mages Guild sent you?  Very good.
 I knew my old friend _questgiver_
 wouldn't let me down.  Here is the
 box.  I hope you have some idea of
 how to open it.  I'm at my wits end.


Record n�12----------
As you cast Open on the chest, the
 lid springs open and an imp flies out.
 
 "Happy birthday, =mage2_ you old fart!"
 the imp cackles in an unnaturally
 deep gravelly voice.


Record n�13----------
You hear the lock click as you cast
 Open on the chest.  Inside is a wand
 inscribed: "To =mage3_ on your 110th
 birthday.  Use me for a preview of
 your 120th birthday!"


Record n�14----------
Smoke pours from the chest as you cast
 Open on it.  The lid pops open, revealing
 an engraved card:
 
 Dear =mage4_,
 
 Hope you like the new place.  Did
 you remember to call the exterminator
 before you moved in?
 
 Your friend,
 
 _mage_


Record n�15----------
The lid of the chest pops open.
 Inside is nothing but a few
 scraps of faded confetti.


Record n�16----------
Tell _questgiver_ I appreciate
 %g2 sending you to help...I guess.
 Of course, if I had known what
 was inside, I might not have
 been so eager to open it!


Record n�17----------
If you can't open it, you may
 as well keep it.  I have
 no use for it anymore.
