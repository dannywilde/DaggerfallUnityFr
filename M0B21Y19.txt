How are you, %pcf?  If you need
 work, I've got somethin' for you.
 Standard protection job.  Interested?


Record n�1----------
Sure, you're lookin' for more high class
 work these days, right?


Record n�2----------
All right.  The client's name is
 _victim_, over at _victimhouse_
 just up the street from here.  %g wants
 you over there right away.  Seemed
 very agitated, you know the type.
 %g'll give you all the details
 when you get there.


Record n�3----------
That's all I know.  Better get movin'.


Record n�4----------
I don't know how I can thank you for
 saving my life, as well as avenging
 my father's death.  Please accept this
 _reward_.  It belonged to my father, and
 I would like you to have it.


Record n�5----------
Too bad about _victim_, eh?  Apparently he was in more 
danger
 than he realized.


Record n�6----------
I know it wasn't your fault, but that business with _victim_
 still makes me feel bad.  I shoulda taken the poor chap
 more seriously, I guess.


Record n�7----------
_darkb_ lives in ___darkb_, I think.  %g's always hanging 
around
 with sinister types, though, so don't go looking for %g2 
unless
 you're looking for trouble.

_darkb_ hangs around in ___darkb_, mainly.


Record n�8----------
_darkb_ is one of the leaders of the local Dark Brotherhood.
 %g3 headquarters is in __darkb_ in ___darkb_.


Record n�9----------
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of ___questgiver_
 has sent me to _victimhouse_
 to meet with a client, _victim_,
 who is in need of some protection.
 _victim_ will give me the full
 details himself.


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 I was too late.  I surprised the
 assassins at _victimhouse_, but
 _victim_ was already dead.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I received a note from _daughter_,
 who says she is _victim_'s daughter.
 She asked me to come visit her at
 _daughterhouse_ in __daughterhouse_
 if I get the chance.


Record n�12----------
%qdt:
 I went to meet _daughter_, but
 it turned out to be an ambush.
 I fought my way free, and am now
 on my way to _safehouse_ in
 __safehouse_ with _daughter_.


Record n�13----------
This is what happens
 to people who don't
 listen to my warnings.
 
 _darkb_


Record n�14----------
Dear %pcn:
 
   My name is _daughter_, daughter
 of _victim_.  When I heard of your
 heroic action in avenging my father's
 death, I wanted to thank you myself.
 I would be grateful if you could come
 see me, if you have time.
 
 _daughter_
 _daughterhouse_,
 __daughterhouse_


Record n�15----------
Back off, mate, or we'll do you the same
 way we did _victim_ over there.


Record n�16----------
You should spend as much time
 sharpening your wits as you do
 sharpening your blade,
 %pcn.  Nothing is simpler
 than laying an ambush for
 you Fighters Guild thugs.


Record n�17----------
Did you hear about _victim_?  Cut down in broad daylight
 in his own home.

Everyone knows the Dark Brotherhood killed _victim_,
 but no one is willing to do anything about it.


Record n�18----------
The Dark Brotherhood is furious over some %ra who
 killed one of their higher-ups.

The Dark Brotherhood has vowed to track down whoever
 broke into their headquarters in ___darkb_.
 I'm sure glad it's not me their after.


Record n�19----------
Yes...?  Wait, you're that Fighters Guild
 musclehead poor old _victim_ thought
 could protect him, aren't you?
 Who let this %ra in here?!


Record n�20----------
%pcn, look out!
 It's a trap!


Record n�21----------
Thank you from rescuing me from
 those assassins.  If you could
 get me to _safehouse_ in
 __safehouse_, I can make my
 escape from %reg on my own from there.


Record n�22----------
A dusty courier flags you down.
 "%pcn?  Thank %god, at last.
 This letter is for you."


Record n�23----------
Thank you for your help,
 but I'll go on my own from here.
