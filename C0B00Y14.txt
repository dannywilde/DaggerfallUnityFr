%pct, I have a dangerous mission for you.
 I will tell you up front it involves slaying
 a rather powerful undead creature.
 Are you still willing to undertake
 this task for __questgiver_?


Record n�1----------
Well, I certainly cannot blame you.
 I myself would not dare it.


Record n�2----------
Your courage honors our order, %pcf.
 We wish to begin cleansing a place
 called ___mondung_.  Long ago it
 was one of our temples, but its
 desecrated corridors are now haunted
 by some undead apparition.  You must
 slay this unquiet spirit and sprinkle
 its body with this specially prepared
 holy water.  If you have not returned
 in =qtime_ days I will burn incense for
 your departed soul and send someone else
 to avenge you.  May %god go with you.


Record n�3----------
%pct, if you did not wish to help
 cleanse ___mondung_, you should
 have told me so before.


Record n�4----------
Praise %god, you have returned safely!
 Our seers already reported that
 the evil within ___mondung_ had
 been cleansed.  You have done well
 in the service of __questgiver_.


Record n�5----------
__questgiver_ is planning to restore ___mondung_ to its former 
glory.

Record n�6----------
It looks like the evil within ___mondung_ is too strong for 
__questgiver_
 to drive out.


Record n�7----------
__questgiver_ sent one of their order to begin cleansing 
___mondung_.


Record n�8----------
Greetings, %pcf.  Your foray into ___mondung_ was a great
 help to us.


Record n�9----------
What can I do for you?  You failed me when I asked you
 for help with the evil spirit of ___mondung_.


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ has sent me
 to slay an undead creature haunting
 ___mondung_.  %g gave me a vial
 of specially prepared holy water
 which I must sprinkle on the monster's
 body in order to prevent its spirit
 from returning.  I have =qtime_ days
 to return to _questgiver_ or %g
 will have to send someone else.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ has sent me
 to slay an undead creature haunting
 ___mondung_.  First, however, I
 must visit _priest_ in __priest_
 of ___priest_, who will place the
 final blessing on a vial of specially
 prepared holy water.  I need to sprinkle
 it on the monster's body in order to
 prevent its spirit from returning to
 ___mondung_.  I have =qtime_ days
 to return to _questgiver_ or %g
 will have to send someone else.


Record n�12----------
Ah, wait, I am so forgetful these days!
 You first need to take the holy water
 to _priest_, of __priest_ in
 ___priest_.  %g will place the final
 blessing on it.


Record n�13----------
_priest_ takes the vial from you
 without a word.  %g gravely blesses
 it, then you.  %g hands it back
 and returns to %g3 meditations.


Record n�14----------
"I am =monster1_!  You may
 slay my material form, but
 I will always return to my
 home here in ___mondung_!"


Record n�15----------
As you sprinkle the holy water
 over =monster1_'s remains, a
 despairing wail echoes through
 the dark halls of ___mondung_,
 slowly fading into the distance.
