Record n�0----------
%pct, __questgiver_ needs you
 for a dangerous mission to retrieve
 one of the lost _item_s of %god.
 You will have to defy the power
 of =lich_, its creator who then
 betrayed the temple and sank into
 evil.  He is now a lich, and still
 guards the _item_.  Are you willing?


Record n�1----------
I understand.  A lich is a fearsome
 opponent for one of your youth and
 inexperience.  Perhaps as you
 mature you will take up this
 again.  %god go with you.


Record n�2----------
I admire your courage, but tremble
 to think of the danger you are about
 to face.  =lich_ guards his _item_
 of %god in ___mondung_.  Remember,
 there is no need to slay the lich,
 just retrieve the _item_ and return
 it to __questgiver_ here.
 If we have no word from you in
 =qtime_ days, we will chant the
 Song of the Departed for you.
 %god's blessings upon you, %pcn.


Record n�3----------
I understand your reluctance to depart,
 %pcf, but waiting will not make
 the danger any less.


Record n�4----------
Praise to great %god!  I had not
 allowed myself to hope that you
 would actually succeed.
 %god's favor will surely shine
 upon you for this deed.  As a
 small token of the Temple's
 gratitude, please accept this
 enchanted _reward_.


Record n�5----------
__questgiver_ hopes to recover their long-lost _item_,
 but who will they find willing to face the lich =lich_?


Record n�6----------
I hear that __questgiver_ now believes that the
 _item_ was never in ___mondung_ after all.


Record n�7----------
Did you hear about the %ra who went into ___mondung_
 and returned with __questgiver_'s _item_?


Record n�8----------
%pcf, you are always welcome here after
 you braved that lich!


Record n�9----------
I do not blame you for failing to retrieve
 our _item_ from ___mondung_, but I am
 disappointed that you accepted an assignment
 that you could not complete.


Record n�10----------
A sinister voice whispers from nowhere,
 
 "The _item_ does not belong to you or the
  sentimental fools of __questgiver_.
  I therefore reclaim what is rightfully mine."
 
 The _item_ vanishes.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 __questgiver_ of ___questgiver_
 has sent me to retrieve a sacred
 object, a _item_, from ___mondung_.
 The catch is that it is guarded by
 =lich_, a lich.  I do not have to
 slay =lich_, however, just retrieve
 the _item_ and return to _questgiver_
 within =qtime_ days.


Record n�12----------
This is surely __questgiver_'s
 long-lost _item_.


Record n�13----------
What?  You not only retrieved
 the sacred _item_, but also killed
 the evil =lich_?  You are truly one
 of %god's favored ones.  You will
 surely rise far in our order.


Record n�14----------
=lich_ hisses in fury:
 
 "You dogs of __questgiver_
  will never have my _item_!
  I made it and I will keep
  it.  Nothing will stop me,
  not even the grave."
