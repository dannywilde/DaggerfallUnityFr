%pct, I am perplexed.  Perhaps you
 can help me with some research.

Hmm, yes, if the internal azimuthal
 vectors really do cross at the anterior
 pole, it should be possible ... eh?
 Oh, %pct, I didn't see you standing
 there.  But how fortuitous!  I need
 someone to help me with my research.
 Are you available?


Record n�1----------
Oh, too bad.  Now, where was I?  Mmm,
 the azimuthal vectors, right.  Let's see...


Record n�2----------
Splendid!  You see, I'm working on a
 particularly thorny problem in theoretical
 applied magicka, and I need a particular
 magic _item_.  Made by _maker_ %g2-
 self.  By all reports, a masterful little
 piece of work, but according to my research,
 impossible.  The internal azimuth vectors are
 such that I cannnot reconcile the externally
 manifested lateral flow lines ... Well, having
 the piece to study would help me immeasurably,
 but I have not had much luck tracking it down.
 The only reference I've come across mentioned
 a catalogue once held by the library at ...
 oh yes, nowadays it's known as ___hintdung_.
 You might also try a colleague of mine,
 _scholar_.  %g is an expert on _maker_.
 Wrote the definitive biography, although in
 my opinion ... ah, well, no time to get into
 that old debate.  You'll find _scholar_
 in a dank hole called ___scholardung_.
 I don't see how %g can abide working in such places.
 Hmm, yes, come back and see me in, say, =time1_
 days and report your findings.  Yes?  Splendid.


Record n�3----------
What do you make of these vector lines?
 I've tried using Mencipha's Theorem to
 reconcile the coefficients, but I just
 end up with a mess.  Perhaps if I tried...


Record n�4----------
Who are you?  Oh good heavens, I remember
 now.  _maker_'s _item_, of course!  And
 here it is.  Well, as it happens, while
 you were gone, I had quite a breakthrough
 in my research.  You see, it wasn't the
 azimuth vectors at all, the key to the
 whole problem is actually ... well, the
 point is, I no longer need the _item_.
 It is a beautiful piece of work, though,
 isn't it?  Why don't you keep it, since
 you went to all the trouble to find
 it for me.  Now if you'll excuse me,
 I must get back to work.


Record n�5----------
Did you see _questgiver_ wandering the streets last night, 
mumbling
 something under %g3 breath?  Crazy old coot!


Record n�6----------
Crazy old _questgiver_ seems more despondent than usual.


Record n�7----------
_questgiver_ has been telling everyone about some %ra who 
saved
 %g3 research.  Hey, that was you, right?


Record n�8----------
Eh?  Oh, my good friend %pcf.  You searched all of %ra
 for that _item_ I wanted.


Record n�9----------
Eh?  Have we met?


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of ___questgiver_'s
 Mages Guild has sent me to search
 for a certain magic _item_ made by
 a _maker_.  _questgiver_
 suggested I should either look
 in ___hintdung_ for an old
 catalogue, or visit _scholar_,
 an expert on _maker_, who is
 currently doing research in
 ___scholardung_.  I am to
 report my findings within
 =time1_ days to _questgiver_.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I found _scholar_ in ___scholardung_,
 but %g was not able to help me in my
 search for _maker_'s _item_.


Record n�12----------
%qdt:
 _scholar_ suggested that I might
 find _maker_'s _item_ somewhere
 in a place called ___itemdung_.


Record n�13----------
%qdt:
 I believe I have found a good
 lead on the _item_.  The old
 catalogue from ___hintdung_
 said that it was once held
 in a place called ___itemdung_.


Record n�14----------
%qdt:
 I found part of the old catalogue
 in ___hintdung_, but it gave no
 indication of the location of
 _maker_'s _item_.


Record n�15----------
%qdt:
 I spoke with _scholar_ in ___scholardung_.
 %g was unable to help me in my search for
 the _item_, but I agreed to get
 some alchemical ingredients for %g2 from
 _contact_ of __contact_ in
 ___contact_ and return in =time2_ days.


Record n�16----------
Item No. 476-A-LCX-08
 
 Type: _item_
 Creator: _maker_ of ___maker_
 
 Description:
 This _item_ is one of _maker_'s
 lesser works, ranking below %g3 famous Wand
 of Verbosity in craftsmanship, and not even
 close to a masterpiece of sheer audacity like
 %g3 Scissors of Styling.  Still, this _item_
 shows _maker_'s distinctive style in the
 many small touches %g puts on all %g3 work:
 the embossed brass fittings with %g3 signature
 stamp, the unusual choice of an enameled finish,
 and especially the mellow amber sparking along
 its exterior flow lines.

Item No. 476-A-LCX-08
 
 Type: _item_
 Creator: _maker_ of ___maker_
 
 Description:
 This _item_ is one of _maker_'s
 lesser works, ranking below %g3 famous Wand
 of Verbosity in craftsmanship, and not even
 close to a masterpiece of sheer audacity like
 %g3 Scissors of Styling.  In the years since
 _maker_'s death, this piece has dropped out
 of sight, perhaps held by some private collector.
 By the extant descriptions of it, this _item_
 showed _maker_'s distinctive style in the
 many small touches %g puts on all %g3 work:
 the embossed brass fittings with %g3 signature
 stamp, the unusual choice of an enameled finish,
 and especially the mellow amber sparking along

   3 doz. newt's tongues (dessicated)
   4.25 oz. powdered unicorn horn (pure northern ONLY!)
   1 _ingredient_ (FRESH this time, for %god's sake)

 Charge to my account.

Record n�19----------
Hullo.  _maker_'s _item_ you say?
 Yes, I believe I ran across a reference
 to that very thing just last week.  Where
 did I put those notes ... Here we are, mmm-
 hmm, "mellow amber sparking" -- that's
 vintage _maker_ for sure.  Looks
 like it was in ___itemdung_, at least
 it was when this was written.  Good luck!


Record n�20----------
Good morning!  Did _contact_ send you
 with those supplies that I ordered?
 Oh, _questgiver_ said I might know
 where to find _maker_'s _item_?
 I'm sorry, but that seems to have
 disappeared shortly after %g3 death,
 and hasn't been heard of since.  A
 real shame.  But could you do me a favor
 since you're here?  I need a few things
 for my work here, and if you could fetch
 them for me, I'd be most grateful.


Record n�21----------
Excellent.  Here, let me jot down what
 I need.  Take this list to _contact_
 of __contact_ in ___contact_.
 %g's the only one I trust to give
 me the exact ingredients I need.
 I'll expect you back here within
 =time2_ days.  Please be prompt.


Record n�22----------
Too busy, eh?  Well, it was nice talking
 to you.  I won't walk you to the door,
 if you don't mind.  Good day!


Record n�23----------
Another shopping list from _scholar_,
 eh?  I swear, if I send another shipment
 out to %g2 without getting paid ...
 "Charge to my account", ha!  That's rich.
 Listen, I'll give you the _ingredient_
 %g asked for, but the rest will have to
 be special ordered, and I'm not doing that
 until %g pays me for everything else
 I've sent to %g2.  I'm sorry, but that's
 the best I can do.


Record n�24----------
Oh, it's you.  Did you bring me the supplies
 I asked for?  What, _contact_ would only
 give you this _ingredient_?  That crusty
 old goat!  I'll give %g2 a piece of my mind
 when I get out of here.  Well, it's better
 than nothing I suppose.  Listen, are you
 still looking for that _item_?  I ran across
 a reference to an old catalogue from an
 exhibition of _maker_'s works.  This
 catalogue is in ___hintdung_.  In fact,
 I can teleport you to the very spot, if you
 like.  You'll have to find your own way
 out, of course.  Shall I teleport
 you to ___hintdung_?


Record n�25----------
Hold on to your hat!  By the way, before you
 go, take this _scholarreward_.  I really
 do appreciate you fetching the _ingredient_
 for me.  Now, away to ___hintdung_.


Record n�26----------
As you wish.  By the way, before you
 go, take this _scholarreward_.  I really
 do appreciate you fetching the _ingredient_
 for me.  I hope you find the _item_.


Record n�27----------
This is undoubtedly _maker_'s _item_.


Record n�28----------
Hullo, %pcn.  Did you manage to track
 down that _item_ of _maker_'s?
 Ah well, that's too bad, but I'm sure
 I will manage to work around the problem
 without it.  I know you did your best.
 Here's _gold_ gold for your trouble.
