Record n�0----------
%pcf, I have an important mission
that will require the utmost discretion.
I can't tell you more unless you agree
to help me. What do you say?


Record n�1----------
%oth, I had expected much more of you.


Record n�2----------
An old friend of mine is in grave danger,
and needs an escort who is handy with a
blade and can keep a secret. Naturally,
I thought of you. _target_ will
meet you at 10:00 tonight at _targethouse_.
%g will tell you more when you arrive.
I would come with you, but since I am known
as %g3 friend, I might lead %g3 enemies
to %g2. Watch your back on this one.


Record n�3----------
We have nothing more to discuss, %pcn.


Record n�4----------
You alerted me to a grave threat to the realm.
Please accept my sincere thanks as well as
this _reward_ gold.


Record n�5----------
_enemy_ has been recruiting mercenaries at ___stronghold_.
I wonder what for?


Record n�6----------
Did you hear about that ambush in __targethouse_? An agent
of the Queen of Sentinel was killed.


Record n�7----------
It seems that one of the court nobles of Sentinel was 
plotting
against the throne, but the Queen found out and destroyed 
his
fortress at ___stronghold_.

_ruler_'s forces attacked ___stronghold_, but I hear that
the target of the whole attack, a _traitor_, got away.


Record n�8----------
I hear you got through to _ruler_, although _target_ bought the 
farm.


Record n�9----------
What happened with that mission to escort  _target_  to  _ruler_?



Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of the __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ asked me
 to meet _target_ at
 _targethouse_ at 10:00
 tonight. I know nothing else
 except that _target_ is
 in danger from powerful enemies.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I met with _target_, and
 we are proceeding to Sentinel.


Record n�12----------
%qdt:
 I was ambushed leaving _targethouse_,
 and _target_ was killed. Before
 %g died, however, %g slipped me a letter
 exposing _traitor_, a member of
 _ruler_'s court in Sentinel,
 as a traitor. _target_'s dying
 wish was that I deliver the letter
 to _ruler_.


Record n�13----------
%qdt:
 I showed _ruler_ the treasonous
 letter, but _traitor_ had
 already fled to %g3 fortress
 of ___stronghold_.
 The Queen asked me to infiltrate
 the fortress and capture or kill
 _traitor_. She gave me =gettraitor_
 days to accomplish this mission
 and return to Sentinel.


Record n�14----------
Dear %pcn,
 
 Change of plans. _questgiver_
 had to leave town quickly, and asked
 me to meet you in _tavern_.
 Please come at once. The matter
 is extremely urgent.
 
_enemy_


Record n�15----------
My dear _enemy_,
 
 I am pleased to hear of your progress
 in training my forces at ___stronghold_.
 I will send more money as soon as I can
 raise it, as you will need to hire more
 troops if we hope to defeat _ruler_.
 You are surely correct that going into open
 battle against her is a lost cause, but I believe
 that even for a coup de main against the
 Castle itself, we will need more men.
 
 We can discuss this matter further in
 person when I arrive at ___stronghold_
 in a few weeks. If you need to reach me
 in the meantime, I am staying in the Palace
 at __palace_. If all goes well, we may soon
 have a new ally. Once the situation here
 is proceeding smoothly again, I must return
 to Sentinel to pay my respects (perhaps my
 "final respects"!) to our dear Queen. Her
 agents have been dogging my steps lately,
 so I shall allay her suspicions by a show of
 fawning subservience which she so appreciates.
 
 Keep me informed of your progress.
 
Most sincerely,
 
_traitor_,
__palace_


Record n�16----------
A small child of indeterminate gender
hands you a note, and runs away
before you have a chance to react.


Record n�17----------
%pcn, right? I'm glad
I managed to contact you. Did
_questgiver_ tell you much
about what was going on? I didn't
think so. Suffice it to say that
the Necromancers are involved.
Dangerous people to cross, indeed. But,
I have an _amulet_ for you which will
warn you if agents of the Necromancers
are nearby. Should come in handy.
Keep a wary eye out, friend.


Record n�18----------
You are %pcn? _questgiver_
described you well. I am _target_.
We must proceed to Sentinel at once.
I can tell you no more, except that
the enemies of _ruler_ would
give much to stop us.


Record n�19----------
_target_ gasps, and you turn
to see a feathered shaft protruding from
%g3 chest. As %g sinks to %g3 knees,
%g slips a letter into your hand, and murmurs,
 
"_traitor_ is a traitor to Sentinel.
You must get this to _ruler_."
 
_target_ is dead.


Record n�20----------
You are suddenly surrounded by a bright
glow. Looking down, you see that the
light is coming from the amulet
_enemy_ gave you. The ground
seems to open beneath your feet,
and darkness engulfs you.


Record n�21----------
Do you give the treasonous letter
to _ruler_?


Record n�22----------
"Yes? What's this letter? Dear %god,
_traitor_ is plotting against me?!
Guards! Search the Castle for _traitor_
and bring him to me at once."
 
Several guards run from the room. A few
minutes later one returns. With a salute, he
reports that _traitor_ is nowhere to be found.
 
_ruler_ turns to you:
 
"He must have been alerted that his treason
was about to be uncovered. Most likely he
has retired to this ___stronghold_ he
refers to in his letter. Under the circumstances,
I would prefer to avoid a direct attack. You are
familiar with the area, yes? Would you perform one
more service for me and bring this traitor to justice?"


Record n�23----------
%pcn, you are proving most loyal to the
throne of Sentinel. I will wait =gettraitor_ days
before assaulting _traitor_'s fortress.
I hereby proclaim _traitor_ outlaw -- capture
him if you can, but kill him if you must.


Record n�24----------
Very well. I will deal with him myself.


Record n�25----------
_ruler_ opens the letter and reads it.
Her face darkens with anger.
 
"There can be no doubt.
This is his personal
seal and signature.
Guards! Go to the
Great Hall and seize
_traitor_ at once,
and throw him in the dungeon."
 
She turns to you.


Record n�26----------
So be it. _traitor_ chose his course,
and paid the consequences, thanks to you.
Here is an enchanted _queenreward_
for your service to Sentinel.


Record n�27----------
%oth! _traitor_ is a slippery one,
indeed. Well, I will track him down
eventually, never fear. Sentinel's
justice will pursue him wherever he
may hide. His associates have all
been arrested or fled the realm, so
_traitor_ no longer poses any threat,
at least. %pcn, please accept
this enchanted _queenreward_
for your service to Sentinel.


Record n�28----------
Do you give the treasonous letter to _traitor_?


Record n�29----------
I seem to have misjudged you, %pcn. Perhaps
we can be friends after all. Here, take this
_traitorreward_ for your troubles.


Record n�30----------
_traitor_ looks at you intently. The
color drains from %g3 face as %g realizes
who you are, and before anyone can stop
%g2 %g turns and bolts for the door.


Record n�31----------
%ra dog, you will pay for your
meddling in _traitor_'s affairs.


Record n�32----------
Surrender and be dragged through
the streets of Sentinel as a public
spectacle? Never!


Record n�33----------
_traitor_ is dead.


Record n�34----------
_traitor_ throws down %g3 weapon.
Thinking %g is surrendering, you
pause in your attack, but instead
%g twists a ring on %g3 finger.
As _traitor_ disappears in a haze
of light, you faintly hear %g2 shout,
 
"Tell that bitch that she
hasn't seen the last of me!"
