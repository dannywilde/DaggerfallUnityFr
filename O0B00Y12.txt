%pcf, I got a job for you if
 you're interested.  A little
 package needs delivering
 to ___contact1_.
 What do you say?


Record n�1----------
Don't do me any favors, pal.


Record n�2----------
Great.  Here's the package, some
 _drugs_.  It needs to be in
 ___contact1_ as soon as
 possible.  _contact1_ will
 meet you there in __contact1_.
 Be careful.  If word of this
 shipment leaks out, we may
 have a bit of trouble with some
 freelance smugglers who think
 they own the business in %reg.


Record n�3----------
Didn't I say "as soon as possible"?


Record n�4----------
I'm glad you made it through.  These
 amateurs don't stand a chance against
 our organization.  Here's _gold_ gold
 for your services.  Good work.


Record n�5----------
I hear the Thieves Guild is having some trouble with an
 upstart smuggling ring.


Record n�6----------
It looks like the Thieves Guild is going to have to give
 up its monopoly on smuggling in %reg.


Record n�7----------
The Thieves Guild seems to have quashed those rival 
smugglers
 that were giving them trouble.


Record n�8----------
Hey, good old %pcn, I remember you.  My reliable courier.


Record n�9----------
So, the smuggler who can't deliver the goods returns.  What do you 
want?


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 I am on my way to ___contact1_
 with a shipment of _drugs_
 for _contact1_, who will
 meet me in __contact1_.
 I was warned to watch out
 for thugs from a rival smuggling
 ring.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I just got a note from _contact1_
 saying %g was unable to meet me in
 ___contact1_.  %g told me to
 go to ___contact2_ instead,
 and deliver the shipment to a
 =contact2_ in __contact2_.


Record n�12----------
%pcn --
 
 Sorry I couldn't meet you in ___contact1_
 as planned.  The heat got too intense for me
 to wait around.  I've arranged an alternate
 drop in ___contact2_.  Look for a =contact2_
 waiting for you in __contact2_.
 
 Watch your back,
 
 _contact1_


Record n�13----------
A small, dirty boy tugs on your sleeve.
 He hands you a scrap of paper then
 dashes off down an alley.


Record n�14----------
When are you Thieves Guild thugs going
 to learn that we control the _drugs_
 business around %reg?
