%pcf, you saved my life when most
of my supposed friends abandoned me.
I am in your debt. My resources are
not what they once were, but accept this
_gold_ gold as a small token of my gratitude.


Record n�1----------
One of _queen_'s high lords was arrested for treason. His 
friends
are pleading for mercy, but the Queen has already scheduled 
his
execution date.


Record n�2----------
They say that _traitor_ escaped from the dungeon of Castle 
Sentinel,
right from under the noses of _queen_'s guards. She must be 
furious!

%qdt:
 I have received a letter from one
 _contact1_, asking me to meet %g2
 at _tavern_ in __tavern_,
 ____tavern_, on some matter having
 do with _traitor_ of Sentinel.


Record n�4----------
%qdt:
 I met with _contact1_, who told
 me that _traitor_ languishes
 in the dungeons of Sentinel, with
 his execution scheduled in =executiondelay_
 days. _contact1_ begged me to
 rescue _traitor_ before it was
 too late.


Record n�5----------
%qdt:
 I have rescued _traitor_ from
 Castle Sentinel's dungeon, and
 am taking %g2 to _safehouse_
 in __safehouse_, ____safehouse_,
 where we will meet an ally of
 _traitor_.


Record n�6----------
Dear %pcn:
 
 If you are a friend of _traitor_,
 please meet me at _tavern_ in
 __tavern_, ____tavern_, as soon as
 possible. This is a matter of life or death!
 
_contact1_


Record n�7----------
%pcn? You were my last hope!
_traitor_'s friends and allies
have all proven faithless after
he was arrested by the tyrant
_queen_ on trumped up charges
of treason. He is now locked
in the dungeons of Castle
Sentinel, awaiting execution.
Please, if you have any regard
for the man, rescue him from certain
death. He often spoke of your skill
and bravery. I know you will help us.


Record n�8----------
%oth, am I glad to see you. We
must get out of here before the
alarm is raised. I was just plotting
my escape when you showed up, but no
need for that now, eh? My strong
right arm, that's what I've always
called you. I promise, when I am
King of Sentinel, you will be there
at my side, the richest lord of the
kingdom! Sounds good, eh? Once
we're clear of pursuit, take me to
__safehouse_ in ____safehouse_.
I have a friend there at
_safehouse_ who will help me
organize the conquest of Sentinel anew.
Lead on, good %pcn, let us away!


Record n�9----------
Raise the alarm! _traitor_
is escaping! =guards_, come quick!


Record n�10----------

and says earnestly:
 
"I thank you for rescuing me from
that black pit of despair, but
I will have to part ways with you here."


Record n�11----------
Did you hear that _traitor_ of Sentinel was executed for treason?

Apparently it was quite a spectacle -- they hanged him in the 
public square
in front of _queen_'s Castle.

_traitor_ of Sentinel was hanged for treason. They say he 
pleaded
for his life quite shamefully before he died.


Record n�12----------
A courier shouts at you to wait.
"%pcn, right? This letter
is for you. Gotta go."
