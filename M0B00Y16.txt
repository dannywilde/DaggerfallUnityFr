Howdy, %pcf.  If you got a few days free,
a job just came in for some giant-killin', and
I thought of you.  Interested?


Record n�1----------
Too busy, eh?  When I was your age,
I was never too busy to off a giant
or two.  Kids these days, I tell ya.


Record n�2----------
Right.  Seems there's this giant, moved
into ___mondung_ a while back and
has been having a fine old time feastin'
on _dummy_'s sheep in the area.  Ate
a few of the local villagers too, I guess,
but old _dummy_ don't seem so concerned
about that.  At any rate, %g wants this giant
taken care of within =qtime_ days, and %g's payin'
_gold_ gold for it.  See ya in a bit.


Record n�3----------
What, the giant died of overeating?
Get going, %pcf.  You got a job to do.


Record n�4----------
Hail the giant-killer!  I knew you
was the right one for the job.
Here's the _gold_ gold.


Record n�5----------
A giant in ___mondung_ is terrorizing the locals, but _dummy_ 
doesn't
seem to care.

That giant in ___mondung_ carried off another villager the other 
day.


Record n�6----------
I'm glad that giant finally moved out of ___mondung_.  I guess it 
got
bored with it's bland diet of villager night after night.


Record n�7----------
Thank %god _dummy_ finally sent someone to kill that giant
in ___mondung_.  It must have killed one of %g precious 
sheep.


Record n�8----------
It's my old friend Giant-Killer %pcf!


Record n�9----------
In my day, you could get kicked out of
the Fighter's Guild if you couldn't kill
a simple giant.  Times change, I guess.


Record n�10----------
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ of the Fighter's Guild
 of ___questgiver_ has hired me to
 kill a giant in ___mondung_.
 I am to report back within =qtime_ days
 for my reward of _gold_ gold.


Record n�11----------
%qdt:
 I rescued a merchant the giant was
 apparently saving for a snack.
 _villager_ asked me to take %g2
 to _store_ in __store_.


Record n�12----------
The giant roars in pain.  You hear
the sound of heavy footsteps coming
towards you.  Perhaps the giant
invited a few friends over for dinner...


Record n�13----------
Thank %god you're here!  I was
on my way to market yesterday
when the giant carried me off along
with four other merchants I was
travelling with.  It already ate them,
I guess it was saving me for later.
Will you please help me get out of this
place?  I'll never make it out on my own.


Record n�14----------
You're a true hero.  Let me introduce myself:
_villager_ of ___villager_.
I was on my way to _store_ in
__store_.  If you could drop me
off there, I would be forever in your debt.


Record n�15----------
I appreciate your help, but I think
I can find my own way from here.


Record n�16----------
You are truly heartless.


Record n�17----------
I've enjoyed your company, %pcf.
You saved my life, and I won't forget it.


Record n�18----------
Hey, here's a map to ___newdung_
one of the other chaps found the
other day.  If I was a couple years
younger, we could tear through it
together, just like the old days.
