Record n�0----------
Here's a little something I've been working on.
See how you like it.  I'm off!


Record n�1----------
%qdt:
 _rebel_, the rebel mage
 who was once my quarry, has
 asked me to meet %g3 messenger
 in _tavern_ in __tavern_.


Record n�2----------
%qdt:
 An atronach sent by _rebel_
 informed me that %g would like me
 to help %g2 explore Direnni Tower
 on the Isle of Balfiera.
 _rebel_ will meet me there,
 somewhere.


Record n�3----------
%pcn:  Greetings!
 
 I hope this note finds you well.
 Are you interested in a little
 adventure?  If so, meet my messenger
 at _tavern_ in __tavern_
 in ____tavern_.
 
Your partner in Unsanctioned Magery,
 
_rebel_


Record n�4----------
A faint scent of brimstone greets you
as you walk through the door.
Is that an atronach over there?
With a note pinned to its
back saying, "HIT ME"?


Record n�5----------
The atronach intones stonily:
 
"Hello %pcn.  I am =atronach_,
humble servant of _rebel_.
%g asks if you would like to explore
Direnni Tower on the Isle of Balfiera
with %g2.  A magical place full of
wonders beyond imagining.  My master
will meet you there in =towertime_ days."
 
With that, =atronach_ disappears
in a puff of smoke.


Record n�6----------
%pcf, good to see you again!
You seem to have started with out
me -- that chest you're carrying
is exactly the thing I was looking
for.  You don't mind if I borrow
it, do you?  Thanks so much!


Record n�7----------
%pcf, I'm glad you could join my
little party.  Listen, I'm looking
for one specific thing, a _item_
which I believe is somewhere within
Direnni Tower.  You can keep anything
else we find, all I want is that box.
Well then, let's be on our way, shall we?


Record n�8----------
Ah, this is the _item_ I was looking for.
Hmm, I was expecting there to be some kind
of guardian... uh oh...


Record n�9----------
Well then, it's been fun.
Perhaps we can do this
again sometime.  Ta ta!


Record n�10----------
Take that! and that! you
moldy old thing!


Record n�11----------
That's the spirit!  How
about a little of this, too!


Record n�12----------
Bloody hell, let's get out
of here!  If I can just
get this spell to work...


Record n�13----------
A raven circles overhead, then alights
on your shoulder.  Most unusually, it
is carrying an engraved card in its beak.
It fixes you with one beady eye, tucks the
card into your shirt, and flaps away.
