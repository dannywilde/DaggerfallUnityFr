Record n�0----------
%pcn, I knew I could count on you.
The friendship of the Queen of Sentinel
is reward enough, but I have prepared
some more tangible gifts as well.


Record n�1----------
_traitor_ escaped from the dungeons of Castle Sentinel, I 
hear.
He was about to be executed for treason, you know.


Record n�2----------
_traitor_ was trying to get Wayrest to support his claim to
the throne of Sentinel, but the _queen_'s agents got to him.
No one knows what happened to him, but I assume he's dead.


Record n�3----------
%qdt:
 I received a letter from _queen_
 of Sentinel.  She says that _traitor_
 has escaped, and she would like me
 to come see her about tracking him down
 again.


Record n�4----------
%qdt:
 _queen_'s spies have learned that
 _traitor_ is in Wayrest, stirring
 up trouble against Sentinel.  He
 is hiding somewhere in the dungeons
 of the royal castle there.  I am
 to find him and bring him back to
 Sentinel for execution.


Record n�5----------
%qdt:
 _traitor_ is my prisoner.  I am
 on my way back to Sentinel to turn
 him over to _queen_.


Record n�6----------
Dear %pcn,
 
   I regret to inform you that your noble
 service to Sentinel has been undone.
 _traitor_ still has a few friends, it seems.
 %g has escaped from the dungeon, only days
 before he was to be hanged.
   I would be most grateful for your assistance
 in putting this matter to rest once and for all.
 Please come and see me at your earliest convenience.
 
Your friend,
 
_queen_ of Sentinel


Record n�7----------
A stocky knight in the livery of Sentinel
stops before you and salutes.
 
"%pcn? A letter for you, personal
message from _queen_ herself."


Record n�8----------
Ah, %pcn, I was hoping you would come.
My spies have located the elusive _traitor_.
He has turned up at the court of Wayrest,
of all places, apparently trying to obtain
support for his pathetic claim to my throne.
Wayrest would not be so rash as to openly
give refuge to a convicted traitor to Sentinel,
but he is hiding somewhere in Castle Wayrest,
and I want you to find him and bring him back.
Alive if possible, but kill him if necessary.
Do not let him escape again.


Record n�9----------
You again! %oth, will you give
me no peace? I'll settle you this time!


Record n�10----------
"Stop! Don't kill me! I surrender!"
 
Do you accept _traitor_'s surrender?


Record n�11----------
The traitor _traitor_ is dead.


Record n�12----------
_traitor_ drops his weapon,
and you quickly bind his hands
and blindfold him to prevent
any further trickery.  Now to make
your escape from Wayrest...


Record n�13----------
Then, by %god, we can die together!


Record n�14----------
Well, well, if it isn't my loyal _traitor_,
come back to me.  Did you really believe you
could escape my wrath? Guards, take him
downstairs and execute him immediately.


Record n�15----------
_traitor_ deserved death.  I would have
preferred to execute him publicly, as
an example to others of his ilk, but I am
pleased that this sordid matter is finally closed.


Record n�16----------
Did you think that you could dispose
of _traitor_ so easily? A Lord of
Sentinel is no one to cross lightly!


Record n�17----------
A knight in Sentinel livery approaches.
"I'll take this traitorous swine
_traitor_ off your hands now."
